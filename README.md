# 🚀 User Management System | React + Vite

A modern Fullstack application for user management, built with React and Vite. This project demonstrates a complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** lifecycle with a reactive and efficient user interface.

## ✨ Key Features

- **User Registration:** Add new users with name, email, and detailed info.
- **Data Visualization:** View all registered users in a clean, organized list.
- **Edit Records:** Real-time updates for existing user data.
- **Delete Operations:** Remove users with instant UI feedback.
- **Form Validation:** Ensuring data integrity before submission.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile and desktop screens.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite & React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Operations:** 100% Functional Fullstack CRUD ✅

## ⚠️ Important: Backend Dependency

**To experience the full functionality of this project, the [Node.js/MongoDB Backend](https://github.com/DevRainer/Nodejs-MongoDB.git) must be running simultaneously.**

All data operations rely on the Backend API. Please ensure:
1. The backend server is active in a separate terminal/VSCode window.
2. The API is running at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).
3. Both services (Frontend & Backend) remain active during use.

**Without the backend, CRUD operations will not persist or display data.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install

- **Start the development server: ** yarn dev
- **The project will be available at http://localhost:5173/
- **To access it from other devices on the same network: ** yarn dev --host
